This project began in my freshman cyber lab class. My peers were using
[Minecraft: Pi Edition](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pi_Edition) (MCPi), which has a
Python API for controlling worlds. I discovered early on that any client can
manipulate an MCPi server and move players, so I created several different
Python scripts to do singular tricks. This version developed because I wanted an
easier way to troll players during a gaming session. The final version of the
script features a terminal-based user interface using object oriented patterns.
I programmed this script independently with input from my instructor.

## Features

- Air Nuke: Create a large explosion or air pocket around a player.
- Turn User into B-52: Continuously drop TNT blocks beneath a player for a
  specified time.
- Flood: Flood the entire map with water.
- Wall: Create a bedrock wall.
