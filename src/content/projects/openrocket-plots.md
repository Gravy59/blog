This project developed from my grade 9 engineering class. We were designing,
building, and launching model rockets with many different parameters. Our
designs used OpenRocket, a F/LOSS CAD tool. A feature of OpenRocket is that it
can simulate launches and generate plotsâ€”but these plots were low-resolution and
not very useful for publication in our technical report. I decided to use Python
to convert the simulation data from a CSV to a high-resolution EPS for LaTeX.
This project is a Jupyter notebook that includes code for converting Vertical
Motion vs. Time and Flight Side Profile plots.
