In my grade 9 cyber class, I discovered that my friend didn't know about
[The SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). His parents were concerned
about the content of SCPs, so I thought it would be a good idea to create a
website that [catalogs the best SCPs](https://scp-db-zeta.vercel.app) from the
SCP Foundation. I built this website with Next.js and Contentlayer. The
rationale for this site existing was that I can curate the collection and
prevent my friend from being exposed to undesirable content; however, this
project was more for me to learn about web design using programmatic generation.
