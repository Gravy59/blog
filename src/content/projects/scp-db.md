In my grade 9 cyber class, I discovered that my friend didn't know about [The SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). His parents were concerned about the content of SCPs, so I thought it would be a good idea to create a website that catalogs the best SCPs from the SCP Foundation. I built this website with Next.js and Contentlayer. The rationale for this site existing was that I can curate the collection and prevent my friend from being exposed to undesirable content; however, this project was more for me to learn about web design using programmatic generation.
