When fake, AI-generated images of Taylor Swift spread virally across social
media, the incident highlighted a concerning reality: AI-generated content has
evolved from a novel technological feat into a force threatening public trust,
creative authenticity, and social stability. Generative AI's capacity to produce
large quantities of text, images, and audio at scale is changing industries,
education, and public discourse. The new AI platform brings a host of concerns:
the potential displacement of human workers, the erosion of intellectual
property rights, and the easy generation of misinformation. Educational
institutions face increasing intellectual dishonesty, artists face AI images'
potential impact on their business, and the public faces a flood of
misinformation and a breakdown of trust. As AI-generated content proliferates
throughout the internet, it becomes necessary to understand the real impact that
machine learning has on trust, authenticity, and industry.

The modern state of AI descends from the development of many different machine
learning architectures. In 2014, the introduction of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) marked a pivotal moment, enabling AI systems to create new
content based on existing datasets[^1]. This was followed by the development of
diffusion models in 2015, which, combined with pre-existing training data and
advanced encoding, made high-resolution image generation possible by 2022[^2].
The CLIP model further advanced AI capabilities by enabling the relation of text
to images and facilitating three-dimensional "thinking"[^1]. Another important
milestone is the 2017 introduction of the Transformer architecture, which led to
the development of powerful models like GPT-4[^3], revolutionizing natural
language processing and generation. These advancements laid the groundwork for
artificial intelligence's rapid growth and widespread impact.

The effects of AI proliferating have shown both positive and negative impacts on
public creativity. The industrial capacity of AI models enables others to
generate content that would undermine traditional artistic processes. Jiang et
al.[^4] comment that "It is now possible for anyone to create hundreds of images
in minutes...and \[start\] a project for a successful Kickstarter campaign in a
fraction of the time it takes for an actual artist". This could have negative
economic impacts on creatives. Concerns exist that the pre-existing data used to
train many common AI models contains copyrighted material. Large datasets like
LAION-5B, which heavily relies on user-generated content from online
platforms[^5], have sparked controversies over copyright infringement and the
ethical use of artists' work. However, some artists view AI as a beneficial tool
to augment their work rather than replace it. De Cremer, Morini Bianzino, and
Falk[^6] suggest that AI-augmented content creation may support creatives and
lower barriers to entry into the art world.

In the education sector, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to
stimulate critical thinking, automate routine tasks, and assist in constructing
arguments and assessment questions[^7]. They can serve as study tools, provide
homework assistance, and aid in creative writing[^8]. However, these uses
coexist with concerns about potential inaccuracies, plagiarism, and the loss of
essential skills like information synthesis[^8].

Regarding AI misuse, malicious actors have new tools for generating
misinformation. For instance, deepfakes---now augmented by AI---have the
potential to spread defamatory content across the internet rapidly [^9].
Real-world examples, such as the spread of AI-generated misinformation during
Indian elections[^10], presents a threat to public trust. Fortunately, there is
growing interest in mitigation strategies to maintain an informed public. Data
provenance, which involves embedding information about a work's origin, is
becoming increasingly favored by policymakers to combat misinformation[^11]. A
key initiative in this area is the Coalition for Content Provenance and
Authenticity, an organization composed of top brands like Adobe, Intel, and
Microsoft to develop standards for embedding creation details, editing history,
and usage rights as data provenance into images[^12]. However, privacy concerns
surround data provenance initiatives because governments could abuse the systems
and identify would-be anonymous dissenters[^13]. Although C2PA and other data
provenance projects are important first steps in combating AI disinformation,
more comprehensive frameworks are being developed to address the difficulties
presented by this quickly developing technology.

Additional regulatory efforts are beginning to take shape to address the
challenges posed by AI-generated content. President Biden's executive order on
AI in the United States aims to increase transparency and mandate disclosure of
relevant information[^14]. Similarly, the European Union's AI Act seeks to
establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for AI technologies[^11]. As AI
continues to grow, the combined efforts of governments, industry leaders, and
legislators will all be critical in mitigating its misuse and preserving public
trust in the digital age.

AI is developing rapidly, and companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, StabilityAI, and
ElevenLabs stand at the forefront of innovation and its consequences. Large
concerns about misinformation exist, particularly in the image and audio space.
ElevenLabs, which makes AI text-to-speech models, began taking steps to suppress
abuse in 2023[^15]. There is a growing integration of AI across various
industries like television, where AI was used to make the opening sequence for
Marvel's _Secret Invasion_[^4]. Public opinion remains divided, with some
viewing AI as a tool for innovation and others perceiving it as a threat to jobs
and creativity.

The discourse regarding generative AI has established a clear divide between its
potential benefits and associated risks. As AI technology becomes more
sophisticated, it has increasingly permeated various sectors, from media to
education. AI-generated content is a detriment to society because it threatens
public trust in online information, harms creators' livelihoods, undermines
academic integrity, and helps perpetuate harmful societal biases.

AI-generated content threatens the public's trust in institutions by
facilitating the spread of misinformation. As advances in AI allow synthetic
content to replicate genuine content closely, the potential for spreading
misinformation escalates. A report by the Electronic Privacy Information Center
illustrates this risk by warning, "AI-generated images and videos provide
several ways for bad actors to impersonate, harass, humiliate, exploit, and
blackmail others." The report also describes how AI misinformation can harm the
public in many fields, including psychologically and reputationally[^9]. These
harms are already evident. In February 2023, a manipulated audio clip falsely
suggesting a Nigerian politician was planning to rig an election circulated on
social media[^16].

Similarly, smear campaigns targeting U.S. politicians used AI-generated images
and videos to erode confidence in public leaders[^16]. Beyond governmental
institutions, AI content also harms celebrities and creators. Anonymous users
were able to generate and distribute sexually explicit photos of the pop singer
Taylor Swift using deepfake technology, which impacted her reputation as a
result[^14]. As AI tools increase, the public will find it harder to distinguish
between truth and fiction, which could undermine trust in media and digital
platforms.

AI-generated content also harms creators' livelihoods and infringes upon
copyrights. Deep-learning companies have often trained their models on artists'
works without consent, allowing users to copy art styles and saturate the market
with AI-generated imitations. Artists like Greg Rutkowski have expressed
frustrations with image models replicating their style without permission[^18].
The proliferation of AI content has sparked outrage among other creators, like
musician Nick Cave, who believe art can't be mimicked and that algorithms cannot
replace creativity[^19]. AI text plagiarism even forced _Clarkesworld_, a
science fiction magazine, to temporarily close submissions due to the influx of
AI-generated short stories[^20]. The saturation of synthetic art devalues
creative works and threatens livelihoods. The erosion of creative integrity
harms individual creators and could have far-reaching effects on industries that
rely on original content.

The impacts of AI-generated content in the creative sphere also resonate with
AI's effects in academia. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to
generate massive amounts of coherent text at scale undermines academic rigor by
assisting students in plagiarism and cheating. Because LLMs can only produce
coherent text by training on original works, LLM content could be an
infringement of intellectual property. Recent studies have found that GPT-4 and
similar LLMs can perform well on academic exams and are more covert than
outright copying[^7]. AI plagiarism in higher education and scientific
literature is particularly growing. An investigation by Liang et al.[^21] found
that across two thousand abstracts for papers related to computer science,
nearly 18% of sentences contained probable AI-generated content. AI-assisted
academic misconduct harms educational ethics and undermines the value of genuine
knowledge.

Generative AI also perpetuates social biases present in the training data that
AI models use. Despite efforts to reduce bias in AI systems, biases in training
datasets inevitably make their way into AI-generated content. For example, the
primary focus of the GPT series of LLMs is to reduce prejudice and improve
safety[^3]. In addition, analysts at Bloomberg News studied the image model
Stable Diffusion. They found that it often reflects common racial and gender
biases, such as associating certain skin tones with certain professions or
social roles. Expanding AI-generated content can continue biases and undermine
fair treatment in the cultural zeitgeist. Despite the significant concerns
regarding AI-generated content, there are still reasons to support generative
AI.

While many creators oppose AI art, others believe it can help augment the
creative process rather than replace artists outright. A common school of
thought is that artists free themselves to focus on higher-order work by
automating more repetitive tasks. Eapen et al. argue that "generative AI tools
can solve an important challenge faced in idea contests: combining or merging a
large number of ideas to produce much stronger ones." They also assert that
generative AI can potentially develop previously unknown solutions. Yale experts
have also noted that as generative models advance, they become more capable of
creating "fundamentally new" art paradigms and eliminating so-called "menial"
tasks[^22]. Rather than supplanting artists, generative AI may become another
tool for creators and can democratize creativity for aspiring artists.

Further evidence in support of generative AI as a tool is clear when observing
different markets. Generative AI offers a solution to repetitive jobs through
automation. A case study of US K-12 teachers saw teachers reporting better
productivity using generative AI for ideas and preparing teaching
materials[^23]. The benefits also extend into public communities as a whole.
Small businesses, who often have to stand against larger enterprises in
workloads, have seen empowerment and enhanced decision-making as a result[^24].
Lowering for tasks like marketing, content creation, and customer service allows
small businesses to compete more effectively. Generative AI can level the
playing field for current and future workload demands.

In addition to helping teachers increase productivity, generative AI can amplify
the educational process. While AI models may not be perfect, they can allow for
a more focused implementation of an educational model for students. That a
language model can complete academic assignments could mean that assignments
need to integrate more than just information to remain relevant. Several
educators in a scholarly study used LLMs like ChatGPT in a proactive manner to
encourage higher-quality responses from their students[^7]. Modern education may
need to adapt to the changing landscape of teaching tools.

While AI-generated content offers potential benefits for creativity and
education, its risks and drawbacks are significant and far more dangerous. The
threats to public trust, creators' livelihoods, academic integrity, and social
equality are serious concerns. As generative AI advances, the public must
implement mitigation strategies for its negative effects. Ultimately,
responsibly developing and using AI-generated content is a primary priority to
ensure AI benefits society without compromising institutions.

Integrating generative AI into our daily lives may democratize artistry and
improve productivity. However, the enthusiasm for this new technology overlooks
AI's limitations, including the inability to produce original work. Recognizing
the constraints of AI is essential to addressing the greater implications of
generative AI on society.

While AI can assist creativity by augmenting artwork, it cannot replace human
creativity. Generative models can only produce an amalgamation of their inputs,
rather than creating original content. For example, the paper for the Latent
Diffusion model that developed into Stable Diffusion describes how
high-resolution images are compressed into a format the model can work with. The
model combines and transforms this data, but cannot create fully independent
pictures from what the model trained on[^2]. This invalidates the notion of
creative augmentation; a model that cannot create original content cannot make
original contributions. In line with this logic, the United States Copyright
Office rejected an artist's registration for a graphic novel augmented by a
generative model, setting the precedent that AI is not original enough to
copyright[^25]. This evidence shows that AI tools, even if humans guide them,
ultimately devalue human creativity.

Proponents of generative AI as a medium cite practical applications of
generative AI, such as automating programming workflows, assisting in creative
tasks, and generating ideas. However, these claims overlook the real-world
limitations of AI. For example, many programmers find GitHub Copilot, a language
model that helps with programming, unreliable and inaccurate, writing code with
subtle issues and inefficiencies. One programmer stated that Copilot often
"wastes time or flat out breaks \[programmers'\] code"[^26]. Similarly,
AI-generated art lacks originality and coherence. _Forbes_ describes how AI art
is often littered with small mistakes, especially with human fingers. Closer
inspection of seemingly innocuous AI images reveals "unsettling elements" that
show a lack of thought, originality, and creativity[^27]. These limitations show
that while generative AI may assist in brainstorming or prototyping, it can be
more problematic than functional when applied to real-world tasks.

In addition to its impracticality in the creative space, generative AI's
educational benefits are equally inflated. While generative models increase
productivity for teachers by helping with grading or lesson plans, they can lead
to over-dependence and reduce critical thinking skills among students. In
addition, the risk of generative models producing false or misleading content
can promote confusion and a disconnect from educational goals. A study of
Chinese university students' perceptions of AI indicated that over 60 percent of
participants were concerned that overusing language models would hinder critical
thinking and creativity and that the generated content would be inaccurate or
misleading[^28]. Using AI as a supplementary tool offers advantages in
controlled environments, but educators must recognize the potential for overuse
and the consequences it could have on students' development.

AI-generated content growth is a complex challenge for modern society. The
advantages of generative AI for productivity, creativity, and education do not
justify its significant risks to public trust, creative integrity, and academic
rigor. The ability to mass-produce synthetic content allows malicious users to
flood digital spaces with misinformation while devaluing human originality and
intellectual property rights. As AI systems continue to develop, society must
build safeguards and regulatory frameworks to protect against these dangers. The
future of digital content depends on maintaining a balance between innovation
and preservation of authenticity. ▲
